## Introduction

This project aims to demonstrate the use of image processing techniques for color inversion and weather detection in videos. It utilizes OpenCV, a popular open-source computer vision library, for image manipulation and processing.

## Dependencies

- CMake
- OpenCV

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/color-inverse-weather-detection.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd color-inverse-weather-detection
    ```

3. Build the project using CMake:

    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```
    or you can build it with my install.sh

    ...bash
    bash install.sh
    into target folder and cd maunally

## Usage

1. Run the compiled executable:

    ```bash
    ./color_inverse_weather_detection
    ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the path to the video file for weather detection.

3. The program will process the video frames, perform color inversion, and detect weather conditions such as sunny, cloudy, or night.
