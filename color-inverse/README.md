Introduction

This project aims to demonstrate the use of image processing techniques for color inversion and weather detection in videos. It utilizes OpenCV, a popular open-source computer vision library, for image manipulation and processing.

Dependencies

CMake
OpenCV
Installation

Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/color-inverse-weather-detection.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
cd color-inverse-weather-detection
Build the project using CMake:
bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
Usage

Run the compiled executable:
bash
Copy code
./color_inverse_weather_detection
Follow the on-screen instructions to input the path to the video file for weather detection.
The program will process the video frames, perform color inversion, and detect weather conditions such as sunny, cloudy, or night.
